# Help! I'm New!

Don't worry, we were all new at some point. We have three suggestions for you...

**1) Read!**

Educating yourself will help you greatly on your journey and there are many, many good guides. Here is a good start: [New to Fetlife and new to the Scene?][0]

(Many more readings for new people [here][1] and a BDSM glossary [here][2])

**2) Attend a KHK munch!**

A munch is a social gathering of kinky people in a non-play 
environment such as a bar. Think of a networking or meet up event, but 
for the kinky and curious.

People who attend wear regular street clothes and are not "cruising,"
but come to relax, socialise, and meet others in the community. There 
is no set agenda and we chat about everything.

Munches are the backbone of the BDSM community and the community is 
important for many reasons: education, safety, skills, sharing, support,
play partners, fun, and fun open-minded people!

**3) Go slow!**

Go slow with new play, new toys, new partners... everything really! 
Whether you discovered kink yesterday or have been waiting your whole 
life, you have plenty of time to explore.

Enjoy!
