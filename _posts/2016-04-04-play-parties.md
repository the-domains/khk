# Play Parties

Our parties are free to attend, and are run in a well-equipped 
dungeon fitted with a wide array of toys and furniture available for 
use. Parties occur every month, and are by invitation only. To get an invitation please see consult our vouching rules.

Please also note these are community events and professional services or money exchange is prohibited.

## What is a Play Party Anyway?

A play party is a safe and fun environment for kinky people to 
experiment and explore their interests. Most people will socialize (much
like a munch) and then play when they feel comfortable. It is also 
perfectly fine to simply socialize and watch scenes without playing 
yourself.

Keep in mind that while nudity and sex are allowed, a play party is 
not an orgy, sex party, swinger's party, nor slave market. While we 
think these are fun ideas, the emphasis is on kink. Kink can be sexual 
or non-sexual, with clothes or without clothes, or any combination of 
leather, lingerie, and latex you so desire. Non-kinky clothing is also 
fine.

Please also note these are community events and professional services or money exchange is prohibited.

### ~ Toys ~

At our play parties we have a wide selection of BDSM furniture, 
equipment, and toys. These are all freely available for use, and we 
encourage everyone to try them out! We would like them to come back in 
one piece however, so do treat them with respect. This includes 
returning them to their proper place after play and making sure they are
not mixed up with your toys and taken home. Any toys used in contact 
with body fluids must be protected by a condom and left in the bathroom 
for future cleaning.

Non-venue toys should not be touched without the owner's permission. 
Some kinky toys are expensive and easily broken. Others are dangerous. 
Some are only to be used on one specific person. Ask if you're not sure 
about anything!

For new people we usually hold dungeon tours to show everyone how all
these strange and spectatular toys work. Ask one of the DMs or Event 
Crew if you want to join.

### ~ Need Help? ~

The organizers will be wearing badges and will be around to help with
anything you need. For example: smoking areas, bathrooms, bag check if 
you have valuables, etc. You can also ask about toys, dungeon 
ettiquette, or opportunities to play.

**DMs** (Dungeon Managers! Or Masters/Mistresses)  
DMs are responsible for safety and the smooth running of the event. If you are planning to do edge play, play with [triggers][0], or will need a lot of space, please inform them.

DMs have the right to interrupt your scene. If this happens, please 
do not take offence; they are here for your safety, and the safety of 
everyone else in the space.

**Event Crew**  
Event crew are the awesome people who give their time to help out! You can also ask them if you need something.

**Photographer**  
The official KHK photographer. See them if you want photos.

Should you have any problems or you are being bothered by anyone, you should talk to one of the DMs or Event Crew _immediately_.

#### Being "Under Someone's Protection"

If you are going to a party alone or you think you would feel 
vulnerable, you can ask to be "under the DM's protection". They can 
usually recommend someone if you talk them about it prior.

## Playing with Others

If you want to play with someone, express your interest politely. If 
that person is interested too, discuss what you would like to do _before you start to play_.
Never touch anyone, use a toy on them, or try to play with them in any 
way unless you have obtained their permission, and the permission of 
their dominant if they have come with one. This especially applies to 
any form of intimate contact.

**Negotiation and consent are essential** and anyone who
breaks this rule may be asked to leave an event and will not be invited
back. Additionally, even if a person has consented to general, 
unspecified play with you it does not mean they are up for everything 
under the sun. Always ask!

Never pressure anyone to say "yes". If you express interest in 
someone at a kinky event and that person says "no," do not continue to 
pressure them.

An ambivalent reaction or lack of reaction is not the same as an 
enthusiastic "yes". If your play partner appears uncertain or ambivalent
it would be wise not to rush into play. Remember that it is a 
dominant's job to read a submissive's reactions and make them feel 
comfortable.

### ~ Safewords ~

Working out a safe-word before play is very important. (A safeword is
a word agreed upon by both parties that can be used to indicate they 
want the scene to end. It's particularly essential in scenes involving 
struggle/coercion play where the sub struggling and saying "no" might be
part of the scene).

### ~ Alcohol ~

Having a drink to relax and socialize is acceptable, but keep it to two or less if you plan on playing! No [drunken masters][1]!! (Or subs)!

If you are inebriated, you are unable to legally consent. If you are 
drunk and playing, you are putting yourself and your play partner at 
risk. Please drink responsibly and don't play unless sober.

Side note: Nervous about playing? Rather than using liquid courage, 
talk to one of our friendly DMs or Event Crew for tips for getting 
started.

Drug use is not accepted under any circumstances and anyone suspected of using illegal drugs will be asked to leave.

### ~ Spectating ~

You are welcome to watch scenes! However, please note that 
interruptions or standing too close can ruin people's headspace and is 
considered quite rude. Keep chatting to the social or smoking area, and 
give people ample space unless invited to come closer.

Joining in a scene without invitation is completely unacceptable. As 
for chatting with the participants, do wait until after the scene and 
people have had a chance to recover.

If you see something that concerns you, rather than interrupt yourself, talk to one of the DMs or Event Crew.
