# Vouching and Safety

Your safety is important to us and we work hard to educate about best practices and create safeguards. These include:

* Guidelines for new people
* Workshops on consent
* Monitors at events
* A vouching policy

While the munches are open to anyone in good standing, the parties, 
workshops, and conferences will only be held with trusted participants 
who respect your boundaries. These events are held in private spaces, 
and you can be assured that all attending are screened or vouched for by
a Community Leader. Our Community Leaders take this responsibility very
seriously, so we will take our time in getting to know each and every 
person. Coming regularly to munches is the best way to ensure you will 
get vouched for our events.
