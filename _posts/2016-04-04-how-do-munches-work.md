# How do 'Munches' Work?

Munches are fun, informal, social events for anyone interested in 
kink or BDSM. While we like to have a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere 
at our munches, we do have a few requests concerning etiquette.

**1 - We respect other people's boundaries and personal space**  
A munch is not a dating club, and should not be treated as such. People 
generally come to socialize and make friends, and aren't ['cruising'][0]
for play partners. Much like any vanilla (non-kinky) event, manners and
common sense rules the day. Any form of harassment will not be 
tolerated and will result in being barred from the event.

**2 - We respect other people's privacy**  
Many attendees may not want to reveal certain personal information to 
you due to not wanting to mix their kinky and personal/professional 
lives, or for any other varied reasons. Following that, keep whatever 
information they do disclose to yourself unless they indicate that they 
don't mind you talking about it to other people.

**3 - We come in regular clothes and don't display toys or fetish items**  
As a social gathering in a public space, people do not dress in 
fetish wear or bring any toys/gear. Also be aware that there may be 
other, non-kinky patrons at the venue, so be respectful of their 
presence.

**4 - We ask that pro sessions are neither solicited nor arranged during munches**  
While we welcome pros (e.g. pro-dommes/doms/subs/etc.) to our events, 
we'd like for this to remain a social event and not turn into a place to
do business.

**5 - If you want to bring a friend to the event, please drop a quick line to the organizers**  
We like to know how many to expect and who is coming to our events. That
said, please do not disclose or mention the venue of the munch in 
forums or other areas that are publicly viewable. Our intention is to 
welcome everyone with an interest in BDSM, but we reserve the right to 
deny invitations to anyone who does not respect our guidelines.

If you have any complaints or suggestions, feel free to get in touch. (_kinkyhongkong@gmail.com_)
