# Workshops Workshops Workshops

******BDSM for Beginners** is a workshop series 
that runs regularly for our newer members to introduce play, fetishes, 
roles, communication, and safety. These workshops are open to all and we
highly recommend them to anyone new to the community.

**Kink Practicals** are monthly hands-on workshops that 
will teach you how to use toys, rope, and popular hard skills (硬性技巧) you
can employ in your scenes. These workshops are open to participants 
vouched by KHK.

Impact Play 空手及鞭打

Sensation Play 肉體感覺

Rope and Bondage 捆綁

We also have occasional classes on massage, toy-making, play piercing, and protocol.
