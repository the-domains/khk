# Who are we?

Kinky Hong Kong (KHK) is Hong Kong's flagship kink group. Created by a 
group of Hong Kong's most experienced members, KHK exists to serve the 
community through education, safety, and great events. We are 
not-for-profit and rely on volunteers who donate their time, equipment, 
and venues.
